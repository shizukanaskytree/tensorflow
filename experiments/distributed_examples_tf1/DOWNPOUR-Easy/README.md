## DOWNPOUR Easy

The same as DOWNPOUR except that instead of updating variables using Adagrad locally, variables are updated using SGD.  This makes implementing the algorithm easier because you don't need to worry about finding the variables created by the local Adagrad optimizer and forcing them to be local variables.
